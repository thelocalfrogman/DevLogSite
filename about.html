                <p style="padding-top: 15px;">I'm George,<br>a computer nerd interested in programming, networking and cyber security.
                                    Building neat little

                    </a>
                    and learning as much as I can in computer science while studying IT formally in Australia.
                </p>

                <p>I appreciate you reading this completely professional, unrelated information; I'd say it's a bit better
                    than Lorem Ipsum though.
                </p>

                <p>ðŸŒ¸ Self-taught HTML and CSS when I was around 11 and was given unrestricted access to the internet ðŸ˜¨.
                    I went from dinky websites to doing the same basic Python projects everyone does and a little bit of
                    Jacascript here and there. My interest in the space came and went over the years before finally committing 
                    to this field and regaining the passion I had for building cool stuff, even if it is a bit shit,.
                </p>

                <p>Currently, I'm of course completing the Certificate III in Information Technology and plan to continue
                                    with the Certificate IV in Cyber Security, as in recent years that has become a genuine passion.
                                    There's so much to learn in the field.
                    <aside>Though nothing evil or radical, I'm not yet at the point of going to the Julian Assange protests yet
                                        ðŸ«£.
                                        but the prospect of defending from real threats is just really cool, and the constant news in the cyber
                                        and
                                        Privacy space is another part of why I
                                        I love it. There are always new things happening and new things to learn.</aside>
                    I find the challenges both in learning and in practice captivating like nothing else. Which I find really
                                cool; one day I do hope to work in the field; pen testing would be awesome.
                </p>

                <p>In the meantime, I'm learning and practicing where I can. Other than my formal studies, I'm working
                                    towards
                                    certifications
                                    like the Comptia A+ as well as the CISCO CCNA, but I'm working more on getting basic networking
                                    certifications and skills before that. Also on and off taking on the Harvard CS 50 and Roppers Academy
                                    cources
                                    which have been awesome for messing with Linux, CTF's, networking protocols, and such, as well as some
                                    cool programming.
