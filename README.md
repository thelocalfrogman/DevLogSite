• Document your code throughout. This includes ensuring that your details are recorded at the
beginning of all pages and CSS sheets.
• Indent your code to make it more readable, both for debugging, and evaluation.
• Use as many techniques of HTML5 design / CSS3 formatting as you like, but the site must run
locally (ie. No server-based code or scripts)
• Ensure your web site runs correctly on as many browsers as possible. I will be testing the sites on
Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Google Chrome, so make sure it works on at least one of those
two!
• Name your starting page “index.htm”
• Allow time to complete your assignment. You will receive ample time in class to do so, but make
sure you use the time wisely.
• Design your site as a realistic website which has a purpose; to advertise a product, a service,
provide information, etc
